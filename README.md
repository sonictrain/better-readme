## Intro
The Better Readme Generator uses JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer to simplify GitHub README creation through user-interactive prompts. 

## Description
The Better Readme Generator is a command-line tool built using JavaScript and Node.js, leveraging the Inquirer package to streamline the process of creating well-structured README files for your GitHub repositories. This tool aims to simplify the README creation process by prompting the user with a series of questions to gather essential information, allowing for customisation of various sections.

3. Install dependencies using

## Usage
